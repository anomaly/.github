# Anomaly
![a sage meditating under a tree](profile/hero.png)

Anomaly is a group of software engineers and designers who build solutions from first principles. We're based all around Australia with offices in [Wagga  Wagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga), [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide) and [Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) (from 2023). A decade ago we built [prestans](https://github.com/anomaly/prestans) a Python framework to build RESTful APIs. It featured forward thinking ideas like data validation, automatic documentation and partial response rendering (someone thought of it cool enough to add to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface), and we promise it wasn't us), which are now common practices in the industry. We've been building modern web applications before they were the cool thing to do üòâ 

Some years ago we built a [game for kids](https://www.anomaly.ltd/ventures/monstapals) to educate them about Australian animals. We have some other ideas that we [are working on](https://www.anomaly.ltd/ventures), and write extensively about [our client projects](https://www.anomaly.ltd/portfolio), which vary from tertiary education, local government and private businesses.

We're partners with [Stripe](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/stripe/) and [Linode](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/linode/) and have deep understanding of their offerings. As such we offer specialised professional services for customers to leverage their technology.

Technologies of interest to us are:
- üêç [Python](https://www.python.org), using frameworks like [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), [TaskIQ](https://taskiq-python.github.io)
- üìÄ PostgreSQL, Redis as databases
- üåã [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) for infrastructure management
- üåÄ React now primarily using [Remix](https://remix.run)
- üï∏ [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) for building static front ends

We prefer building mobile [apps for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/anomaly-software-pty-ltd/id298807962), but happy to work with Android as well. 

Here you will find many open source projects that we maintain (amongst others that we [sponsor](https://github.com/orgs/anomaly/sponsoring)), ones that we are most foucsed on are:

- [Labs](https://github.com/anomaly/labs) - a set of production grade templates for building infrastructure and web applications using our technologies of choice. We also intend to build a set of courses for people to learn about these technologies.
- [Wattle](https://github.com/wattlehq/) - a set of applications focused towards the public sector to ease with operations like management of memberships for recreation centres, gyms, etc.

We also take time to write about our work on our [blog](https://www.anomaly.ltd/blog/) and are writing a [set of articles](https://zen.anomaly.ltd) about what we have learnt from running a digital business.

If you think we can help you with a project then please feel to [reach out to us](https://www.anomaly.ltd/contact/). 

Thank you for stopping by üôè
